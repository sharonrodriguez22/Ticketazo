QA Automation Project: Ticketazo User Registration

This project tests the user registration process on the Ticketazo website. I automated negative test cases using Cypress to make sure the registration works correctly.

## Purpose of the Tests
The main goal of this project is to ensure the user registration works as expected. Testing negative cases is important because it helps find errors and problems before the feature reaches the user, improving the website's quality and user experience.

## About the Project
This project was created as a practical assignment for an automation testing course. It demonstrates the application of automated testing skills in a real web scenario, including test planning, test execution, and reporting.

## Technologies Used
* Cypress for automation testing
* JavaScript for test scripts
* GitHub for version control

## How to Run
* Clone the repository: git clone
* Install dependencies: npm install
